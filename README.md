Explanatory Memo for Visual Argument Revisions: 

Upon reviewing comment responses from the project, I agreed that the image could be enhanced to better the project.  

I began revising by removing the ending words (as recommended) on the "Twitter user..." quote at the top.  In addition, I shifted the text over a bit so it was more left aligned in contrast to the right aligned focal question.  Finally, though subtle, I edited the text color to be a light gray rather than white.  A slight change, but one that I find successfully blends the text a bit more so it does not overpower or draw attention away from the focal question. 

For the focal question, I first enlarged the font.  In response to the Canvas recommendations, the only color I felt might make a stronger impact while upholing the tone of the message was red.  I attempted to make this change (as reflected by the sample image), but couldn't help feel as though it was still too dark against the background and didn't successfully make as impactful of a change as I desired.  I played around a bit and decided to add a layer of red separating the white letters and black shadowing.  With the slightly toned down color of the top statement, the red is placed in between the other letter layers to add the attention-grabbing factor of having a color pop within the grayscale, without taking away from the aesthetic look of the black and white lettering.
